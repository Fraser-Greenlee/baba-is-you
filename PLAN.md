# Plan

One interesting option for the game is to get the core mechanics down then have the game start with almost no rules & tiles then after you get WIN it adds some new ones.

It'll do this in groups of tile + text changes.

The text tiles are either refactored to fit all together or it could even have multiple pages of rules.

To decide on groups of text + tiles to add I could have both YOU and ENEMY play through it as AI and see if the game is winnable and a reasonable amount of turns to win with ideally some complexity.

This could be computed offline for a range of scenarious.

The AI works by scoring all possible moves + actions and always taking the best possible move when searching or randomly picking the top 3 if enemy AI.
